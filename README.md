## Abstract
This research aims to compare the performance of decision tree-based and Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based student time management advising systems. The study includes the generation of a synthetic dataset to represent student profiles and the implementation of an MDP framework. The MDP framework incorporates knowledge representation and decision-making components, enabling the system to provide personalized time management recommendations. The findings contribute to understanding the advantages of MDPs in student advising systems and their impact on student satisfaction and academic achievement.

## Introduction
Effective time management is crucial for students to optimize their academic performance and overall well- being. This research investigates the use of decision tree- based and MDP-based systems for student time management advising. The study compares their performance in terms of decision-making accuracy, adaptability, and customized recommendations. The research aims to enhance student satisfaction and improve academic achievement by providing personalized time management guidance.

## Literature Review
- __Knowledge representation__ methods involve structuring and organizing information to support reasoning and decision- making. Different approaches like logic-based methods, semantic networks, ontologies, and probabilistic models are used for this purpose.

- __Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)__ are mathematical frameworks used to model decision-making in uncertain environments. They include states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards. MDPs are commonly used in reinforcement learning to model sequential decision-making tasks, enabling agents to make optimal decisions based on expected rewards and future states.

- __Decision trees__ are widely used for knowledge representation and machine learning. They provide a visual representation of decisions and their outcomes. Decision trees offer simplicity, interpretability, and the ability to handle various types of data. They are also capable of handling missing values and are computationally efficient.

- However, __decision trees__ have limitations. They can be sensitive to small changes in the data, leading to different tree structures and instability. Overfitting, where the tree memorizes training data and performs poorly on new data, is also a concern. Decision trees may struggle to capture complex relationships and interactions among variables.

- Employing __MDPs__ in student advising programs brings several advantages. MDPs can model the sequential nature of student decision-making, allowing for personalized and adaptive recommendations based on individual characteristics, preferences, and learning styles. They account for uncertainty and dynamics, considering factors like changing academic contexts and evolving student goals.

- __MDPs__ provide a framework for optimizing long-term outcomes, balancing immediate rewards with future benefits. By using reinforcement learning algorithms with MDPs, student advising systems can continuously learn and improve their recommendations over time.

- It's important to recognize that the specific advantages and disadvantages of using __MDPs__ in student advising may vary based on the context, implementation, and unique challenges of the advising domain. A thorough literature review will provide a deeper understanding of the current research, practical considerations, and the state-of-the-art in knowledge representation methods, __MDPs__, and student advising programs.

>The use of __Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)__ especially with __Q-learning policy__ in student advising systems represents an innovative approach to improving decision-making and providing personalized recommendations.

> This literature overview explores studies that have utilized MDPs and Q- learning in educational contexts, focusing on the optimization of student advising systems.
